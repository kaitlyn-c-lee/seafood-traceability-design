As a metric of IUU risk, we used the IUU Fishing Index, which quantifies countries’ multidimensional exposure and response to IUU fishing (Luque and Donlan 2019). In particular, we used mean Port Scores for each SIMP product, weighted by exporter countries’ tonnes of imports to the U.S. Port scores refer to countries’ responsibilities to manage fishery products at ports, especially with reference to the United Nations Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA). The index’s Port Score depends on several indicators, including countries’ PSMA status, compliance with obligations to Regional Fishery Management Organizations, designation of ports for fishing fleets, reports by fisheries observers on port compliance, reports by official monitors on port compliance, rates of entry by foreign fishing or intermediary vessels, and numbers of fishing ports. While coverage of the IUU Fishing Index for exporter countries is incomplete, we considered Port Scores for counts, tonnages, and values of products imported to the U.S. from countries included in the Index  (n = X)at publication.
